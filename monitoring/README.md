## Configure Prometheus  

Log in to your Prometheus server and edit the configuration file:
/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml

```bash
- job_name: storyRPC
  static_configs:

```

Restart Prometheus:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart prometheus
sudo journalctl -u prometheus -f --no-hostname -o cat
```

## Story Metrics

Story metrics provide essential information for monitoring and evaluating the performance and status of the Story network. These metrics cover a wide range of aspects, from block height to total bandwidth usage.

For a complete description of the available metrics, check out the metrics document below.
