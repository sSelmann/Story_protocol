___
## 🔄 Sync Status

*cometbft_blocksync_syncing*

Indicates whether the node is synchronizing blocks.
Value: Displays 1 if the node is synchronizing and 0 if it is not, helping to diagnose the synchronization status.

## 📏 Consensus Height

*cometbft_consensus_height*

Measures the height of the consensus block.
Value: Number representing the last block reached by the node consensus.

## ⬆️ Latest Block Height

*cometbft_consensus_latest_block_height*

This is the number of the highest block processed by the node, indicating whether it is up to date with the network.
Value: Number representing highest block processed by the node.

## 📦 Block Size

*cometbft_consensus_block_size_bytes*

Provides the size of individual blocks processed by the node. It reflects the amount of data contained in a block.
Value: Size of each block in bytes.

## 🤝 Peers Connected

*cometbft_p2p_peers*

Monitors the number of peers connected to the node in the P2P network.
Value: Number of connected peers.

## 🧱 Chain Size

*cometbft_consensus_chain_size_bytes*

Shows the cumulative size of the blockchain over time.
Value: Total size of the blockchain in bytes.

## 🕓 Late Votes

*cometbft_consensus_late_votes*

Captures instances of votes received too late in the consensus process.
Value: Number of late votes received by the node.

## 📨 Proposal Receive Count

*cometbft_consensus_proposal_receive_count*

Measures the number of block proposals received, categorized by their status (accepted/rejected).
Value: Total number of proposals received.

## 🚀 Begin Blocker Duration

*cosmos_begin_blocker*

Time taken to execute the begin blocker per Cosmos SDK module.
Value: Execution time distribution (quantiles) for each module.

## 🛑 End Blocker Duration

*cosmos_end_blocker*

Time taken to execute the end blocker per Cosmos SDK module.
Value: Execution time distribution (quantiles) for each module.

## ⚙️ Consensus Parameter Updates

*cometbft_state_consensus_param_updates*

Counts how many times consensus parameters were updated.
Value: Number of updates since the node started.

## ⚔️ Byzantine Validators Power

*cometbft_consensus_byzantine_validators_power*

Total voting power of validators that engaged in double-signing.
Value: Sum of byzantine validators' power.

## 🕵️ Byzantine Validators

*cometbft_consensus_byzantine_validators*

Counts how many validators have engaged in byzantine behavior.
Value: Number of byzantine validators.

## 📑 Duplicate Block Part

*cometbft_consensus_duplicate_block_part*

Instances of receiving the same block part more than once.
Value: Number of duplicate block parts.

## 🗳️ Duplicate Vote

*cometbft_consensus_duplicate_vote*

Occurrences of duplicate votes during consensus.
Value: Number of duplicate votes.

## 🔢 Number of Transactions

*cometbft_consensus_num_txs*

Shows how many transactions were included in the latest block.
Value: Number of transactions in the most recent block.

## 🧮 Total Transactions

*cometbft_consensus_total_txs*

Indicates the total transactions processed by the node.
Value: Accumulated number of transactions.

## 📥 P2P Message Receive Bytes Total

*cometbft_p2p_message_receive_bytes_total*

Tracks data received for each message type in the P2P network.
Value: Number of bytes received.

## 📤 P2P Message Send Bytes Total

*cometbft_p2p_message_send_bytes_total*

Tracks data sent for each message type in the P2P network.
Value: Number of bytes sent.

## ♻️ GC Pause Time

*cosmos_runtime_gc_pause_ns*

Shows the pause duration caused by garbage collection.
Value: GC pause time in nanoseconds.

## 🧪 Additional Metrics

### ABCI Method Timings

*cometbft_abci_connection_method_timing_seconds*

Histogram showing response times for ABCI methods like `commit`, `info`, `process_proposal`.
